# SGAN_Multifake_class
This is a markdown sheet in Python where 
an artificial intelligence algorithm is 
designed based on the SGANs multiclass 
deeplearning algorithm for the detection
of false fingerprints. In short, the 
algorithm detects through a variational 
autoencoder whether the input fingerprint 
as an image is falsified or not. 
The precision with which the algorithm 
detects fingerprints is 92%. 
although it can still be improved ..
